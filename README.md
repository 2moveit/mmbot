# mmbot## Overviewmmbot is an attempt to port github's [Hubot](http://www.github.com/github/hubot) to C#.## GoalsThe main goal of mmbot is to provide a chat bot written in C# with all the functionality of Hubot but with a script environment more familiar to .Net devs. Another major goal is that hubot scripts should be easy to convert into mmbot scripts. This may mean that some weird design choices are made in the API but it should still be very usable, customizable and familiar to .Net devs
